# Network Monitor
Test your internet speeds and monitor the results over time in a graph or list form.  

This application includes:
- A backend server built using [Platformatic DB](https://platformatic.dev/) which runs the speed tests, stores the results and exposes a REST API and GraphQL API.
- A dashboard application which interfaces with the APIs and lets you view the results over time in a graph 

**Important Note**: This project uses the [speedtest-net](https://www.npmjs.com/package/speedtest-net) package which in turn uses the [Speedtest CLI](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli).
The [Terms of Use](https://www.speedtest.net/about/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.speedtest.net/about/privacy) are automatically accepted when running the application & CLI , so you
should review these yourself before using this application.
